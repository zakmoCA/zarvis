# zarvis
**zarvis** is a tool in consolidating all my notes in the form of an LLM-powered queryable CLI tool via chat trained on my data.

Also building a user-interface as a CLI tool for it [here at mybrain](https://github.com/zakmoCA/mybrain), its UI wrapper for the engine and with node/js as a potential for web-based ui in future. 

### Scope

- chunk/embed/vector-store for ingested text via docs or stdin
- native + llm-based parsing of text and generating structured output
- stored data semantic search + retrieval for querying
- query interface + chatbot
